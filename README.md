# The Remake CLI

This is the Remake CLI, which you should use to generate a Remake application. 

## How to generate a Remake application

**1. Install [Node.js (12.16+)](https://nodejs.org/)**

**2. Create a project using the Remake CLI**

```
npx remake create my-app
```

**3. Run the project**

```
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

You now have an app running at `http://localhost:3000`. Your app's code is in the `/app` directory and your database is in the `/app/data` directory.
